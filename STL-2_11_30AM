STL - Array:

-Array is a linear collection of similar elements.

-Array container in STL provides us the implementation os static array.

syntax:

include array in header file

array <int, 5> obj

-->creating array objects:

array<object_type, array_size> array_name;

It creates an empty array of object_type with maximum size of array_size.

-->Assignment/Initialization

array <int, 5> dataarray = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}; //declaration and initialization

-->Member functions:

-at()
-[]->subscript operator
-front()
-back()
-fill()
-swap()
-size()
-begin()
-end()

1. at()

This method returns value in the array at the given range.

If the given range is greater than the array size, out of range exceptions is thrown.

2. [] operator

The use of operator[] is same as it was for normal arrays.

3. front() and back()

front() method returns the first element in the array.

Back() method returns the last element in the array.

4.  fill()

This method assigns the given value to every element of the array.

5. swap()

This method swaps the content of two arrays of same type and same size.

It swapss index wise, thus element of index i of first array will be swapped with the element of index i of the second array.

-firstarray.swap(secondarray);

6. size()

This method returns the number of element present in the array.

7. begin() and end()

begin() method returns an iterator pointing to the first element of the array.

end() method returns an iterator pointing to an element next to the last element in the array.
